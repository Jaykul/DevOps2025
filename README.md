# DevOps and PowerShell Global Summit 2025

This is all three of the presentations I did at the DevOps and PowerShell Global Summit in April 2025.

- [The Rise of Open Standards in Observability](https://github.com/Jaykul/DevOps2025/blob/25663d63457748f758360a97cb95a705d954816f/The%20Rise%20of%20Open%20Standards%20in%20Observability.pdf)
- [Mistake-Proofing: Poka-Yoke for PowerShell scripts and functions](https://github.com/Jaykul/DevOps2025/blob/main/Mistake%20Proofing.pdf)
- [CLI Tools for DevOps](https://github.com/Jaykul/DevOps2025/blob/main/CLI%20Tools%20for%20DevOps.pdf)

### Made with [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)!


The source for the presentations is in "talks" -- you have to change the name of the presentation in 2 places in [slides.md](https://github.com/Jaykul/DevOps2025/blob/main/slides.md) -- it currently says "OpenTelemetry" and you need to replace that with one of the other folder names under "talks".

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- visit http://localhost:3030
