# The Rise of Open Standards in Observability

This talk will explore the proliferation of open standards in observability, and how they are changing the way we monitor and manage our systems. You will learn about different types of telemetry, including Tracing, Metrics, Logging and Profiling, and the "Baggage" that goes with them. You will see demonstrations of instrumenting, collecting, and transforming telemetry from scripts, build and deployment pipelines, tests, and of course, from applications. Finally you will see how to visualize and analyze telemetry, and how to use it to understand systems better, and analyze their performance and behavior.

The initial focus of this talk will be the protocols, APIs, and standardized schemas from OpenTelemetry, as well as their SDKs and tools and other compatible systems. Then, you will learn how to instrument scripts, libraries and applications so you can add custom metrics to everything from your builds to your business decisions. You will learn how collectors not only collect, but transform data, and how you can route data to different backends, and visualize it in different ways. By the end you'll understand how to generate, collect and visualize telemetry data, and how it can help you to understand your system better, and analyze it's performance and behavior
